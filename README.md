## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Violaine and I'm a data analyst living in CÃ³rdoba, Spain.

 ðŸŒ± After many years working in sales and finance, I start over and did a bootcamp with Adalab to learn about being a Data Analyst.

 Some of the tools I managed are Python, MySQL, Tableau, PowerBI thanks to personal and group projects.
